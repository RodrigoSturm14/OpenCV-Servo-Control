# Description
Object detection system capable of controlling the position of a servo motor by image procesing, using `OpenCV`, `Python` and a `ESP32` micro-controller. The goal is to develop a system that follows the position of an object being tracked with a servo motor.

# Demo and overview
In order to know the position of the object, screen divisions were made:

Turn on an LED if the object is in the center division, and turn it off whether the object is on the left or in the right
