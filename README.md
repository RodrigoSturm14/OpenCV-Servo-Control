# Description
Object detection system capable of controlling the position of a servo motor by image procesing, using `OpenCV`, `Python` and a `ESP32` micro-controller. The goal is to develop a system that follows the position of an object being tracked with a servo motor.

# Demo and overview

First the program gets the center of the object being tracked (see the üü¶ dot) in order to trigger an action whether the centroid is in the left, center or right division:

</p>

Therefore, if the object is on center section, an LED turn on, and if it is on the left or right section, the LED will turn off:
