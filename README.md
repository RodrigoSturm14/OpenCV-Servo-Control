# Description
Object detection system capable of controlling the position of a servo motor by image procesing, using `OpenCV`, `Python` and an `ESP32` micro-controller. The goal is to develop a system capable of moving a servo motor depending of the object's position being tracked.

# Demo and overview

First the program gets the center of the object being tracked (see the üü¶ dot), in order to trigger an action whether the center point is in the left, center or right division.

Therefore, if the object is on center section, the servo motor moves 90¬∞, if it is on the left section it will move 180¬∞ and 0¬∞ on the right one:

| Screen divisions | Output servo control |
|         :---:            |          :---:         |

> [!NOTE]
> 
> _Currently, the Python program is just capable of detecting and tracking things with certain colours, for example green objects._

# Improvement areas
### To-Do list
- [ ] Use a cellphone for object detection. Currently the Python program uses the laptop camara; using a cellphone camara will improve the frames's quality and the scability of the application.
- [ ] Add other ways of object recognition. At the moment the application just uses a basic mask color detection to track the objects; the next goal is to detect specific objects, like books, persons, or a football ball.

# Notes
This repo is being develop, it will be updated with the latest upgrades.
