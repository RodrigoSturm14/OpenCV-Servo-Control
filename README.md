# Description
Object detection system capable of controlling the position of a servo motor by image procesing, using `OpenCV`, `Python` and a `ESP32` micro-controller. The goal is to develop a system that follows the position of an object being tracked with a servo motor.

# Demo and overview

First the program gets the center of the object being tracked (see the üü¶ dot), in order to trigger an action whether the center point is in the left, center or right division.

Therefore, if the object is on center section, the servo motor moves 90¬∞, if it is on the left section it will move 180¬∞ and 0¬∞ on the right one:

| Screen divisions | Output servo control |
|         :---:            |          :---:         |
